# Changelog

Every change to this repository, newest first. Dates are absolute.
Status of the project as a whole lives in [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).

## 2026-11-04

### Added
- Project created at `projects/OfficeManagementSystem` from the
  *Master Office Management System SRS v2.0* brief.
- `docs/Master_Office_Management_System_SRS_v2.docx` — original requirements
  document kept in-repo for future reference.
- `scripts/extract-srs.py` and `docs/SRS.md` — the Word SRS rendered to
  markdown, regenerable with `npm run docs:srs` so the two cannot drift.
- `docs/PLAN.md` — scope reading of the SRS, technology decisions with
  rationale, nine implementation phases, engineering rules.
- `PROGRESS.md` — living status document.
- Next.js 16 / React 19 / TypeScript strict / Tailwind CSS v4 scaffold:
  `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`,
  `eslint.config.mjs`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`.

### Decided
- Dependencies kept to eight runtime packages
  (`@neondatabase/serverless`, `bcryptjs`, `leaflet`, `lucide-react`, `next`,
  `react`, `react-dom`, `zod`). No ORM, no chart library, no auth library,
  no date library, no `clsx` — each replaced by a few lines of own code, per
  the brief's request for the most optimised design.
- UUID primary keys throughout, as specified in SRS section 4.
